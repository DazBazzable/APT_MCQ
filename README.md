# APT MCQ

8th July 2019<br/>
There are no current issues identified with 2017 & 2018- please feedback however if you find any issues/bugs. This code is provided "as-is", and to be run locally on your own computer.
<br/><br/>
Note: 
The 2016 Mock exam is now uploaded, but will require checks of the MCQ model answering matching and possible correction (already one issue identified around q92 with answer out of range)
<br/><br/>
I would recommend download the folder on your computer and open up the intro html file to run

Best of luck for your exams!
